Joined Github **{{ ACCOUNT_AGE }}** years ago.

Since then I pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

Sometimes I blog about software engineering on my [medium page](https://medium.com/@lukasbach). You can find out more about my projects and what else I do on [lukasbach.com](https://lukasbach.com)
